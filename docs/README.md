## Design Principles

1. **No Rounded Corners** - Sharp, geometric edges throughout
2. **Bold Typography** - Space Grotesk for headings, Inter for body
3. **High Contrast** - Strong color differentiation
4. **Accent Borders** - 4px/8px borders for emphasis
5. **Tight Grids** - Visible gaps, structured layouts
